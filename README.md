# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

This repository is a refactor of the Horiseon website, following the scout rule, and with new web accessibility. 
I updated SEO navigation link, title, and footer. I added the sementic element header, as well as comments throughout. I consolidated the benefits and content sections. And I added alt elements.
